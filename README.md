#  Crypto for Fun!
It's a simple cryptography library created by icefires.

The foundamental framework and tools is from library CryptoSwift.

### HAVE DONE
- Block: AES, DES, Twofish
- Digest: None
- Asymmetrical: None

### TO DO LIST
- ECC.
- RSA.
- Digest algorithm (including but not limited) MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512.
- Other AES Finalist algorithm(Block Cipher).

All in all, Cryptography is so COOOOOOOOL!
